BMI Calculator
The BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator allows you to estimate whether you are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on your height and weight. To use the BMI Calculator, enter your weight in kilograms and your height in meters, and the calculator will provide you with your BMI value and corresponding weight status.

Color Changing Background
The Color Changing Background is a simple interactive feature that allows you to change the background color of the web page by clicking on a button. Each time you click the button, the background color will change randomly to create a visually dynamic experience.

Digital Clock
The Digital Clock component displays the current time in a 24-hour format. The time is updated in real-time, so you always have an accurate representation of the current time. This feature can be useful if you need to keep track of time while using the other tools or simply want to know the current time.

Number Guessing Game
The Number Guessing Game is an entertaining activity that tests your ability to guess a random number within a given range. You will be provided with a range of numbers, and you must guess the correct number within that range.
